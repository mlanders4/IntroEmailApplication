## Windows

1. Download the following:

    - [.NET 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)
    - [Resharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/#section=web-installer)
    - [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

    You have a 30 day free Resharper trial, but if you want to use it or other Jetbrains products after that, you can fill out [this form](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students/) to receive a student license. To activate Reshaper, first open Visual Studio and run the Resharper executable. Then, close and reopen Visual Studio.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Create an "app password" by following the steps listed [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en). **PLEASE USE A THROW-AWAY ACCOUNT FOR THIS LAB.**

4. Open the project in Visual Studio and navigate to `Program.cs`.

5. Modify the *name*, *email address*, *username*, and *password* (there are `TODO` comments showing you where to update the code).

6. Run the application by hitting the green, outlined play button (*Start Without Debugging*) or by hitting `Ctrl + F5`. Send an email and ensure that the program works correctly.

7. From your menu bar, click `Extensions -> Inspect -> Code Issues in Solution`, look at the ReSharper warnings in the code pane, and resolve each one.

8. Add `try-catch` blocks where appropriate.

9. Add meaningful comments to the code.

10. Take some time to hover over the various classes used and get comfortable with Intellisense in Visual Studio. Turn in the `Program.cs` file when you are done.
